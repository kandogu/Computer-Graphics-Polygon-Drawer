Doğukan Köse - 21602375 - CS 465 - Project 1

Followings Files are needed for the project:

Common
kochCurves.html
kochCurves.js

These files can be found in the "Source" folder.

The program can be run with opening kochCurves.html file on safari or google chrome.
I implemented it on safari, but I tried it also on chrome browser. 
In order to run the project you should have all files in the same directory.

kochCurves.html and kochCurves.js are written by me.

However, Common folder is taken from example codes and used in this project to run webgl program.
